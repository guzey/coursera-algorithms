# Graph Search and Connectivity

This week we were asked to implement a dfs-based algorithm that would find all the connected components of a directed graph and return the 5 largest of them.

The explanation of the algorithm is here: https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-graphs-data-structures/lecture/rng2S/computing-strong-components-the-algorithm

kosaraju_ugly.py is the first correct implementation of the algorithm.

kosaraju_pretty.py is the final, well-styled, well-commented, and optimized (main loop runs 3x faster) version of kosaraju_ugly.py.

1.txt, 2.txt, 3.txt, 4.txt, and 5.txt are the test graphs from the Coursera forums.
