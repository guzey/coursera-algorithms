# Karger's algorithm

This week we were asked to implement the Karger's algorithm for finding the minimum cut of a graph. I slacked a bit by using the networkx library :) (this trick didn't work the next week, though. The graph got absurdly huge, and I had to write everything myself)

The explanation of an algorithm is here: https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-divide-conquer/lecture/FKAnq/random-contraction-algorithm
