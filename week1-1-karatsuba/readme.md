# Karatsuba algorithm

This week we were asked to implement a Karatsuba's multiplication algorithm. It improves on the naive (standard) multiplication algorithm, being approximately O(n^1.585) instead of the naive O(n^2). More on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karatsuba_algorithm).

The explanation of the algorithm is here: https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-divide-conquer/lecture/wKEYL/karatsuba-multiplication
