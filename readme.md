This is a collection of my solutions for the programming assignments of Coursera's [Algorithms Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms) taught by Tim Roughgarden of Stanford University. All code is in Python 3.

The most difficult assignment was definitely Kosaraju's algorithm during week2-1. Coincidentally, starting from week2-1 all code is well-commented :)
